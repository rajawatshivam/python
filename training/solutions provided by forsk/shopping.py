Problem Statement:
    We are going to make a "Shopping List" app. 
    Run the python script to start using it.
    Put new things into the list one at a time
    Enter the word DONE - in all CAPS - to QUIT the program
    And once i quit, I want the app to show me everything thats on my list.

Hint:
    Step 1: Make a list to hold onto our items.
    Step 2: Print out instructions on how to use the app

    Step 3: Ask for new items
    Step 4: Add new items to our list
    Step 5: Be able to quit the app with DONE

    Step 6: print out the list

#   Make a list to hold onto our items.
shopping_list = []

# Print out instructions on how to use the app
print ("What should we pick up at the store ?")
print ("Enter 'DONE' to stop adding items.")

while True:
    # ask for new items
    new_item = input("> ")

    # be able to quit the app
    if (new_item == 'DONE'):
        break
    
    # add new items to our list
    shopping_list.append(new_item)

#  print out the list
